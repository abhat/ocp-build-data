# ocp-build-data

Welcome to the OpenShift ocp-build-data repo, managed by ART.
This repository is the source of truth for all images built for any OpenShift Container Platform release.
However, you will not find any data in the `master` branch as all data lives in branches specific to each version of OCP. For example, OCP 4.1 data lives in the [`openshift-4.1`](https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/openshift-4.1) branch.

If your images are in dist-git, then ART has a service that can mirror your
images once a day to `registry.reg-aws`. The
[`misc-sync`](https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/misc-sync)
branch contains the configuration information. Specify the branch you build out
of in dist-git and the `<repo>/<name>` of your image there. This is for
software outside OpenShift that must be tested with OpenShift.

# Contributing

All changes to this repo must be submitted as pull requests against the appropriate branch for the version of OCP targeted by your change. If you are unsure, please contact [aos-team-art@redhat.com](mailto:aos-team-art@redhat.com)

# Documentation
